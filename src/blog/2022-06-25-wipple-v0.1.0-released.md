After over two years of development, I'm proud to announce that [Wipple](https://wipple.gramer.dev) v0.1.0 is released! This initial release contains the compiler with support for the trait-based type system, as well as the [Wipple Playground](https://playground.wipple.gramer.dev) and the [Wipple Guide](https://guide.wipple.gramer.dev).

There's a lot left to do, however, so stay tuned for more updates!
